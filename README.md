Comparative Regulatory Strategy Portfolio
This repository showcases my work as a B.Tech student exploring comparative regulatory strategies. 
It includes analyses and insights gained through coursework and independent study, focusing on understanding how regulations differ across various contexts. 
The aim is to demonstrate my growing understanding of regulatory frameworks and their strategic implications.
Within this portfolio, you'll find comparative studies, strategic outlines, and potentially case study analyses related to specific regulatory domains. 
This collection represents my learning journey in navigating the complexities of regulatory environments and applying strategic thinking to address them. 
I welcome any feedback or insights as I continue to develop my skills in this area.
